Welcome, crazy user! Before you start playing my awesome game, please take a moment to read the terms below. Remember, not reading this document doesn’t exempt you from the responsibility for any potential outbursts of laughter or awkward situations. You can either accept them or just start playing. Your call!

1. What is this app?
"Talk, but Carefully" is an app designed to help you have a great time with friends—by embarrassing them to the max.

2. Who's behind this?
This app was created by just one person—yes, one! So if something doesn’t work, there’s only one person to blame. Some features might not work as expected, but hey, at least you only have one person to complain to. That’s me—your reliable developer!
"Maybe it’s not responsive, but at least it loads super slowly!"

This app was made possible thanks to Taboo Cards API (https://taboocardsapi.com/en), created by Michał Kuliński.
Big shoutout to them! Remember to check them out:

3. Terms of Use
Use wisely: This game is meant for entertainment. If you’re not in the mood for any potentially embarrassing situations, no worries—you don’t have to play.
No whining if you play: Playing? Then go all in and enjoy the moment! But remember—be a little careful, because once you make a fool of yourself, there's no undo button.

4. License & Intellectual Property
This app is my creation—from the very first line of code to the tiniest button. That means it belongs to me, and I don’t want anyone copying, selling, modifying, or doing anything else with it without my explicit permission.
Seriously, I appreciate your creativity, but if you want to do something with it, just ask.
Remember: You’re using this app under a personal, non-exclusive, and non-transferable license. That doesn’t mean you can do whatever you want—have fun, but don’t get any wild ideas!

5. Limitation of Liability
I know this might sound boring, but I have to say it: I’m not responsible for your antics, accidental blunders during gameplay, or any other consequences that may arise from using this game. The game is purely for fun (and maybe a little stress). So if something goes wrong… let’s be real, don’t take it too seriously!

6. Personal Data
Your data? What data? This app doesn’t collect any personal data and doesn’t request unnecessary permissions, like location access.

7. Changes to the Terms
I reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. But hey, don’t be mad—it’s just a refresh. Nothing’s going to change in a way that will suddenly ruin your life.

8. Summary
Everything you’ve just read is here to make sure you feel safe and know what to expect while having fun with friends. Play responsibly, don’t take yourself too seriously, and everyone will have a blast!
