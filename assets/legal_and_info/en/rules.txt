The game is played in two teams competing for points. The first team to reach the point limit wins!

One person from the guessing team becomes the describer. Their task is to guide their teammates toward guessing a specific word or phrase displayed on the screen.

While describing, certain forbidden words cannot be used. These words are listed below the main term and must be avoided at all costs! Each team has a limited time to guess as many terms as possible.

The team earns a point for every correctly guessed word. Warning â€“ if the describer uses a forbidden word, they lose a point!

A selected player from the opposing team monitors to ensure no forbidden words are spoken.
